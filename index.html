<meta name="description" content="Infinite humanity's part of the homonymous book on science and technology through the futuristic machine posthumanism (or the future of humanity) to improve the physical and cognitive abilities of a human species. Manipulating different designs and programming of HTML5 / CSS3 - Javascript - Photoshop - Dreamweaver with sliding on horizontal screen, and different devices (desktop, tablet and mobile) to create a reflective space of the technological processes of humanity. Impossible to predict a question of technology and experimental science applied to the transformation of the human being. So the dehumanization by the absence of the inclusive society to generate such a painful situation.">

    <p class="text_column"><span class="title-ih">A question of the human being?</span><br/>“Reflection on the ethical challenges of emerging technologies's a challenge [,] but also an imperative. It's part of that exercise, deeply human: the reflection of man on his own reality. In the future of his existence, the humanity has been leaving a wake of his thinking and, on many occasions, an advance towards what we call civilization, which implies the recognition of the rights and the dignity of each and every one of us who integrate the human species.”<span class="author-ih">Foreword by César Nombela Cano on the book of "Infinite Humanity: Ethical challenges of Emerging Technologies" written by Albert Cortinas and Miguel Ángel Serra (Coordinators) of 2016.</span></p>
    <p class="text_column"><span class="title-ih">Where is human enhancement &amp; neuro/neo education?</span><br/>THAT'S THE ONLY SECRET <br/>Singularity - Human enhancement - Neuroeducation</p>
    <p class="text_column"><span class="title-ih">ASPIRATION OR IMPROVEMENT?</span><br/>To perfect the humanity throughout all time. We are concerned both with human beings and with new technologies to improve individually the whole of singularity and diversity.<br/>We all want to improve the planet through body, mind, spirituality and interaction with new converging technologies and neuroeducation. <br/>However, for the future post-human or the transhuman will be replaced with the current human being, because the disability will be eliminated with the biological limitations: auditory, visual, physical and intellectual. It will gain with the mechanical or artificial limitations through the evolutionary process induced by the emergent technologies of the post-human and the transhuman. They will overcome with superintelligence, superlongevity and super-wellness.<br/>
	WE’RE IN DANGER OF EXTINCTION OF DISABILITY!</p>

      <p>The whole species's about to artificially evolve to become the transhumanist movement with the increase of the technological process, however, due to the development of artificial intelligence and the convergence of technologies. In any human, —especially related to persons in situation of disability— will cause a disaster "great vital chaos" of the unimaginable social, political and economic changes, and impossible to predict by any human will disappear or diminish instantly.
Although it is not prudence towards a different look on the useless thought or "dehumanizing".</p>
