DESCRIPTION:

Infinite humanity's part of the homonymous book on science and technology through the futuristic machine "posthumanism" (or the future of humanity) to improve the physical and cognitive abilities of a human species. Manipulating different designs and programming of HTML5 / CSS3 - Javascript - Photoshop - Dreamweaver with sliding on horizontal screen, and different devices (desktop, tablet and mobile) to create a reflective space of the technological processes of humanity. Impossible to predict a question of technology and experimental science applied to the transformation of the human being. So the dehumanization by the absence of the inclusive society to generate such a painful situation.

It’s a collection of graphic designs and webs that use the manipulation and the interactive tests to understand the behavior of users in the digital environment. In general, more variables are manipulated to determine the experimental method of the computer language, or codification through the systematic process in various causes. Using different artistic software programs, both the web developer and the graphic design for the personal computer in general. This allows us to know human existence through emerging technology. To observe a culture favorable to human improvement through our genetic heritage.
